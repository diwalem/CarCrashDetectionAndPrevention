# CarCrashDetectionAndPrevention

This project aims at helping people who have met with accidents and are unable to reach any emergency services on time. “Save Lives” is an enterprise that helps these people by tracking such situations with Sensor Systems and contact emergency services on their behalf.
Implemented an ecosystem model that assists people following car accidents to rapidly connect them with emergency services. 
Implemented an algorithm based on the location of the accident, that alerts nearby hospitals and police organizations.
Prepared analysis reports using jGraph to prevent further accidents.
